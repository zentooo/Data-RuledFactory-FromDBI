NAME
    Data::RuledFactory::FromDBI - subclass of Data::RuledFactory for
    creating rule from DBI fuzzily.

VERSION
    This document describes Data::RuledFactory::FromDBI version 0.01.

SYNOPSIS
        # assume that you have a table on your DB such like this:

        ---- TODO


        use Data::RuledFactory::FromDBI;

        # ... and have the dbh for that DB.
        my $rf = Data::RuledFactory::FromDBI->new(dbh => $dbh);

        # you need not to define all rules for each column manually.
        # define the rules only you need.

        $rf->from_table("article", +{
            published_on => [
                RangeRandom =>+{
                    min => DateTime->new( year => 2011, month => 12, day => 1 )->epoch,
                    max => DateTime->new( year => 2011, month => 12, day => 24 )->epoch,
                    incremental => 1,
                    integer => 1,
                }
            ]
        });

        while ( $rf->has_next ) {
            my $d = $rf->next;
            # insert auto-generated data to DB with DBI or whatelse.
        }


        ### If insertion failed somehow ( because of DB's constraint ? )
        ### then you define a rule manually :)

        $rf->from_table("article", +{
            published_on => [
                RangeRandom =>+{
                    min => DateTime->new( year => 2011, month => 12, day => 1 )->epoch,
                    max => DateTime->new( year => 2011, month => 12, day => 24 )->epoch,
                    incremental => 1,
                    integer => 1,
                }
            ],
            status => [
                ListRandom => { data => [0, 1, 2] } ];
